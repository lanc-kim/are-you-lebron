# Are You LeBron?

Simple question-answer python-based program used to determine whether or not you are in-fact LeBron. 

## About This Project

This project is a lighthearted attempt of mine to practice using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) while learning about Python. The program makes decisions based on user input to decide if you're LeBron.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13.3**: The programming language used to implement the logic and conditionals.
- **PyCharm**: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write and debug the code.

## What I Learned

- **Conditional Logic**: I learned how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions based on user input.
- **String Handling**: I practiced converting user input to lowercase to handle case-insensitive comparisons.
- **Logical Operators**: I utilized `and`, `or`, and `not` operators to combine multiple conditions and make complex decisions.

## Next Steps

- Improve the program to include more decision-making options or different character checks.
- Enhance the user experience by adding more interactive features or extending the program with additional sports trivia.
- Explore implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) or converting the program into a web application.
